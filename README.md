# QuizOMatic3000-App
Android app that showcases a list of questions that the user has to answer to win.

This is basically the approach I made to create a sort of quiz app within my Android
course at Udacity. 

Functionality is pretty simple: the user answers the different quiz cards and the app
evaluates if the user answered correctly. The answer is always showed through a Toast
message.
